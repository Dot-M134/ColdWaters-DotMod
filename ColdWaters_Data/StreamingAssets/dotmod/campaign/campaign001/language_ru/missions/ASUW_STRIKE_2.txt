SACLANT SENDS // My personal congratulations to commanding officer <PLAYERNAME> and crew for delivering this massive blow to enemy naval forces. The Reds will think twice before committing other high value assets to the fight, even against our missile subs.  It is an honor to serve as your commander.

Discouraged to hear you lost this opportunity against such a high priority target. Enemy task force will no doubt continue to pose a major threat to our boys in the boomers.
