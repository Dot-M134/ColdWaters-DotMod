History=The Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers is a United States Navy class of destroyer built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multi-function passive electronically scanned array radar. The class is named for Admiral Arleigh Burke, an American destroyer officer in World War II, and later Chief of Naval Operations. The lead ship, USS Arleigh Burke, was commissioned during Admiral Burke's lifetime. The Arleigh Burke Flight IIA ships several new features, an integrated hangar for two SH-60B anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, a raised stern facing Aegis radars arrays, and the Mk41 VLS loading crane was removed thus allowing for 6 additional munitions to be stored. The Mk141 Harpoon launcher and the TACTAS were removed.\n\nFor gameplay, all FIIA will retain the TACTAS towed sonar arrays until integration of sonar dipping and sonobuoys are added to helicopters.
