History=The Trafalgar class were designed in the early 1970s during the Cold War as a refinement of the preceding Swiftsure class. Including HMS Dreadnought, the Trafalgar class are the fifth class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines to enter service with the Royal Navy. The first of the class, HMS Trafalgar, was ordered on 7 April 1977 and completed in 1983. The last, HMS Triumph, was ordered on 3 January 1986 and completed in 1991. All seven boats of the class were built and completed by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard.\nIn the 1990s the Trafalgar-class received a mid-life upgrade, being fitted with the integrated Sonar 2074 suite. This was a long-range, active/passive, multi-function suite using HF, LF and FM frequencies across a range of sonars arrays: bow, flank arrays, reelable towed array, and a clip on towed array. The Spearfish Heavyweight Torpedo was also introduced to replace the much derided Tigerfish.
