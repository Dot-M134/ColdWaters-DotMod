Description=MSC Modern Large Cargo Ship
History=The last of the dry-cargo freighters, these large ships are fast and outfitted with an assortment of cranes and derricks to handle break-bulk cargo. While state-of-the-art when built in the late 1960s, they were quickly overshadowed by the emergence of the container ship, and while some were modified to carry containers, they would never be as profitable.\n\nThe United States Military Sealift Command (MSC) charters several of these ships from civilian companies for use in supporting military operations. With the outbreak of war they would all be pressed into service transporting military material to Europe across the Atlantic. Many cargo ships in military service were given the designation of Cape class.
