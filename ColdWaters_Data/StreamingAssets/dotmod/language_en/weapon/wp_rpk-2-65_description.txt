WeaponDescription=Special: Large calibre\nThe RPK-2 "Vyuga-65"(NATO reporting name: SS-N-15B Starfish) is a larger version of SS-N-15 designed for use in 650mm torpedo tubes instead of 530mm tubes. It carries more potent AT-2 torpedo.
2nd variant:  Special: Large calibre\nThe development of the RPK-2 anti-submarine missile was set by decree of the Soviet Union's Council of Ministers in 1960, on instructions of the Navy, to increase the combat effectiveness of submarines especially to counter the increasing threat posed by Western submarines armed with nuclear ballistic missiles. SKB-143 Design Bureau was instructed to carry out the project of the missile and the experimental means concerning its testing at sea. The new anti-submarine missile system was carried out into two calibres: 533 and 650 mm. The resulting variants were designated "Vyuga-53" and "Vyuga-65". Despite sharing similar structural characteristics, while the "Vyuga-53" was designed to deploy a single free-fall nuclear warhead, the "Vyuga-65" is armed with a single AT-2UM 533mm heavyweight ASW torpedo. These missile systems are operational in the weaponry of Project 705, 705K (NATO: ALFA class SSN), 671 (NATO: VICTOR-I class SSN), 671RT (NATO: VICTOR-II class SSN), 671RTM and RTMK (NATO: VICTOR-III class SSN) submarines.
