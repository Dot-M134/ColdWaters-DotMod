WeaponDescriptiveName=Mark 37 Mod 1 Torpedo
WeaponDescription=The Mark 37 Mod 1 Torpedo was the United States Navy's primary submarine-launched torpedo from 1960 to 1967, when the upgrade kits to upgrade the weapon to the Mod 2 variant were released. When the weapon was introduced in 1960, several other contemporary weapons (such as the Mark 39), and some older weapons (Mark 35) were immediately decommissioned. The weapon was only marginally slower than the Mod 0 variant and incorporated wire-guidance from the Mark 39 Torpedo in order to greatly bolster use against maneuvering enemy submarines.
