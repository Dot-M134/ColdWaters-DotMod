WeaponDescriptiveName=Mark 24 Mod 2+ "Tigerfish" Heavyweight Torpedo
WeaponDescription=The Mark 24 Mod 2+ Tigerfish was an improved version of the Mark 24 Mod 2 Tigerfish heavyweight acoustic homing torpedo, used by the Royal Navy. The Marconi Consolidation Programme of the early 1980s finally produced the Mod 2 with reliability improved to 80%, which the Royal Navy accepted as the best that could be achieved with the antiquated Mark 24 design. By 1987 all 600 Tigerfish had been modified to the Mod 2 standard. The final upgrade series (Mod 2+) entered service in 1992.
