WeaponDescription=Special: Surface-to-Air & Anti-Ship Missile\n\nThe RIM-66 Standard is an medium range surface-to-air missile (SAM) and anti ship missile originally developed for the United States Navy. The RIM-67 was developed as a replacement for the RIM-8 Talos, a 1950s system deployed on a variety of USN ships, and eventually replaced the RIM-2 Terrier as well, since it was of a similar size and fitted existing Terrier launchers and magazines. The RIM-66 Standard MR was essentially the same missile without the booster stage, designed to replace the RIM-24 Tartar. The RIM-66/67 series thus became the US Navy's universal SAM system, hence the "Standard Missile" moniker. Guidance system is universal and allows switch between missile, aircraft and ship-attack mode. Mode can be switched in the weapon settings just before launch.
