WeaponDescription=Special: Prototype -- Only two units can be carried at once.\n\nThe Yu-6 is a domestic Chinese torpedo which originally entered service in 2005. However, prototype variants sporting a contra-rotating screw were available for unit testing as early as 1999. As these earlier variants had not yet moved to a more-efficient pump-jet propulsion (which would not be ready until 2003), they were louder, slower, and had shorter range. Domestic Chinese sources indicate that about this time the PLAN had ordered a wire spool with a maximum length of 35km, so it is estimated that the range of the prototype Yu-6 at that time was about that same distance. Despite the early nature of the prototype, by this point the weapon had been fully rated for 600m. The weapon features a homing system developed from that of a Mark 48 Mod 4, and also features wake-homing for use against surface targets.
